# Optimising_Exercise_Structural_MRI
This is the code repository for the optimising exercise study for structural MRI data (i.e., pre-processing, longitudinal/cross sectional cortical thickness, hippocampus volumetry using LASHiS and ASHS).

All code is labelled logically and should be run in PBS.

some of the code is adapted for SLURM to be run on a seperate cluster.
